Exploring New Study Habits
</summary>

Learning online will likely mean you need to practice study habits that differ to ones practiced during face-to-face instruction. Below are some suggested strategies and tools to try out for online learning:

* Exercises for online learning from CLAS: logon to [myCLAS](https://myclas.sa.ucsb.edu/login.aspx) and search for the Academic Skills workshop titled Learning Online: Three Exercises.
* Reading effectively using the [SQ3R method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ona44EaMSv4)
* Distributed practice: Break up your studying into short sessions distributed across time - the opposite of cramming at the last minute.
* Practice testing: Getting something wrong can help you retain the right answer. The best practice tests are the ones that force you to do free recall, not just recognize the right answer. More practice tests are better than fewer.
* Self-explanation: Having to explain to yourself why something is correct or how information fits together significantly aids learning. The practice of relating it to other information makes this different from just summarizing.

Essentials of Time Management
</summary>

Remote learning might mean that you have less structure in your day. It's very tempting to sleep in each day and put off tasks until you really have to do them. However, that is not an effective way to manage your time or facilitate your learning.

Use your Google Calendar and create some structure for your time. Having a routine and entering it into your calendar is helpful for tracking whether you're also taking care of your mental and physical health. Breaks, exercise, and fresh air are necessary!

The ONDAS Student Center Peer Mentors offer helpful advice in these videos:

* [Time Management during Remote Instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wjz522Ybak)
* [Getting Organized](https://youtu.be/EUv9iU4-C4s)
* [How to Use Your Google Calendar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daPu_IpIDl8)

Note-taking for Online Courses
</summary>

Everyone has their own preferences for note-taking, but you may want to try different strategies for an online course.

Just because you can rewatch a video or look at slides online doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take notes. Otherwise, you’ll just be re-reading or rewatching a lot, which isn’t a very effective learning technique. 

You'll most likely be using a single screen, so you'll have to balance viewing your video/participating in discussion with note-taking. Many guides about online learning recommend you take handwritten notes to vary the media you are using. You can pause videos and note timestamps in your notes to return to spots later.

Learn new strategies by viewing the following presentation:

Mindfulness Techniques for Remote Learning
</summary>

Now, more than ever, it's important to take care of ourselves and our mental health. At times, this experience may get frustrating and stressful, but we know you'll get through this. Below are resources for incorporating mindfulness into the remote learning experience from Dr. Virginia Beaufort, Director of the Undergraduate Mentorship Program. 

**Mindfulness Techniques for Concentration & Focus:**

Importance of Connections
</summary>

Remote learning might feel isolating, but it doesn't have to be a lonely experience. We highly recommend staying connected to your instructors, classmates, friends, and family during this time. It's important to feel connection and community.

Participate in class discussions, online forums, and virtual office hours. Contribute your ideas and don't be afraid to ask questions! Most likely, you're asking a question that someone else also has.

Online study groups are possible! Connect with classmates through GauchoSpace and form accountability buddies. Having a friend to discuss assignments, review material, and work through main points is important. Consider using one of the following to connect with others:

* Zoom 
* Google Hangouts
* FaceTime
* WhatsApp
* GroupMe

The ONDAS Student Center Peer Mentors have a video with
[tips on how to form and structure a virtual study group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq8VVLAlfxM&t=2s).

Student organizations can also be a way to form connections. For more information on student orgs, visit [Shoreline (information on events and registered student groups)](https://shoreline.ucsb.edu/home_login)

Using Email
</summary>

It's important to check your UCSB email daily. You'll want to pay attention to emails from your instructors but also notifications that you may be receiving from GauchoSpace and other online learning tools.

Compose clear email messages and practice good email etiquette. In a large course, your professor might be receiving a high volume of emails. Please note that it may take some time for your professors to get back to you.

Email tips:

First, if your instructor has asked you to use something other than email (e.g. Piazza, Slack, a Gauchospace or Canvas forum), please try that first.

If you are sending an email:

* Use your UCSB email address
* Address your instructor professionally
* Tell them your name and what class you are in
* State your question or request
* If appropriate, state what you would like to see happen
* End with a salutation
* Sign your full name

Here's an example email demonstrating these tips:

Study Spaces
</summary>

Both indoor and outdoor spaces might be conducive to your specific study habits/style.

At home, away from UCSB, and struggling to find a study space? Consider the following:

* Quiet parks (use sunblock and remember to hydrate)
* Patios, balconies, or other outdoor areas adjacent to your home
* A part of the home that can be repurposed, which might be quieter (the garage, attic, or basement)
* A stationary vehicle

In the UCSB vicinity, and struggling to find a study space? Consider the following:

* SRB - Seating and electrical outlets are available outdoors on the ocean and mountain sides of the building
* HSSB Quad - Seating and solar charging stations are available
* Buchanan Hall Quad - Seating is available
* SSMS Quad - Limited seating is available, but this is a less populated option
